    <p>I'm interested in all things related to the science of learning, education, and technology. Currently, our lab is pursuing
    research projects in the following areas:
    <ul>
        <li>Retrieval processes and retrieval-based learning</li>
        <li>Development of computer-based learning tools</li>
        <li>Complex learning, comprehension, and knowledge application</li>
        <li>Learning and cognitive strategies in children</li>
        <li>Metacognition and self-regulated learning</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>My research interests center on instructional design and improving the teaching of STEM disciplines in grades K-16 through effective pedagogical practices. More specifically, my research agenda is focused on (a) evaluating the active learning construct, (b) determining the optimal dosage amount and schedule of active learning and lecture, (c) applying cognitive psychology principles to pedagogy, and (d) assessing the quality of the educational literature. </p>

    <p>Broadly speaking, my research centers on improving educational outcomes by applying cognitive psychology. I am particularly interested in evaluating the effectiveness of various learning strategies, optimizing learning through the combination of multiple learning activities, examining how learners regulate their study practices, and designing interventions that encourage learners to incorporate more effective learning strategies into their study routines. Looking ahead, I plan to pursue a research career outside of academia where I can leverage my understanding of human psychology and research abilities to provide meaningful contributions.</p>
