## Retrieval-Based Learning

A central focus of research in the Cognition and Learning Lab is the effect of retrieval practice on learning and long-term retention. Our work has established the effectiveness of retrieval-based learning as a potent learning tool, identified some of the best practices for implementing retrieval practice, and generalized it to a wide range of materials, subject populations, and educational settings.

## Mechanisms of Retrieval-Based Learning

In addition to generalizing retrieval practice to educational materials and settings, we are interested in delineating the mechanisms of retrieval-based learning. The theoretical account we are currently developing is known as the episodic context account. Briefly, the theory proposes that when learners engage in retrieval practice, they update the context representation associated with the retrieved knowledge. The updated context representation produced via retrieval practice can then serve as an effective retrieval cue when learners need to retrieve and reconstruct knowledge again in the future.

## Metacognition and Self-Regulated Learning

Other research in our lab has focused on metacognition, which refers to the ability to monitor one's own learning and make effective decisions to improve learning. Our research on metacognition has established that many learners engage in relatively passive strategies, like repetitive reading, much more frequently than they do active strategies, like retrieval practice. Across a wide range of studies, we have examined several factors that influence peoples' judgments about their own learning and factors that influence the choices they make when they regulate their learning.

## Educational Applications of Retrieval-Based Learning

A major focus of our research has been on applying retrieval practice to improve learning of educational materials. This research has examined effective ways to structure learning activities that incorporate retrieval practice â€“ for instance, by guiding learners to repeatedly retrieve conceptual material (Grimaldi & Karpicke, 2014), providing prompts during retrieval activities (Smith, Blunt, Whiffen, & Karpicke, 2016), sequencing short-answer and multiple choice questions (Smith & Karpicke, 2014), and embedding questions throughout lectures and multimedia presentations (Weinstein, Nunes, & Karpicke, 2016).
