# Undergraduate Research Opportunities

In the Cognition and Learning Laboratory, we conduct basic and applied research on human learning, memory, and cognition. Our research sits at the interface between cognitive science and education. We are especially interested in applying the science of learning to improve educational practices.

Students will be involved in all phases of research, including designing experiments, testing participants, and analyzing data. Students will also participate in regularly scheduled lab meetings and discussions of readings on cognitive science, learning, and education.
