# Purpose

The Cognition and Learning Laboratory conducts basic and applied research on how people learn. Basic research is aimed at deepening our understanding of mechanisms of learning. Applied research is focused on taking what we know about the cognitive science of learning to enhance learning in real world settings, specifically in educational contexts.

This is a research laboratory, so the ultimate purpose of the lab is to complete research projects. Everyone in the lab is here to contribute to this mission (see [People and Roles](people.md)). Every research project involves multiple phases (see [Overview of the Research Process](research-process.md)). It is therefore essential that everyone in the lab stay coordinated in order to complete projects.
