# Funding

Research in our laboratory is currently funded by grants from the [James S. McDonnell Foundation](https://www.jsmf.org/) and the [National Institute of Health](https://www.nih.gov/). In the recent past, our laboratory has also been funded by the [Institute of Education Sciences](https://ies.ed.gov/) within the U.S. Department of Education, the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/), and the [Spencer Foundation](https://www.spencer.org/). 

We are accountable to these funding agencies to complete research projects carefully and as planned and to document and report all of our work to these agencies.
