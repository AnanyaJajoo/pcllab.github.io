# Getting On Board

There are several things you will need to do to get on board and prepared to work in the lab.  

- **Complete a registration form** (PSY 390/391/498 only). You will obtain this from your academic advisor and email it to Dr. Katpick (karpicke@purdue.edu) to sign. Once the form is signed you will need to return it to your advisor. Make sure to have the form returned before the deadline for adding a course. View the deadlines [here](https://www.purdue.edu/registrar/calendars/2019-20-Academic-Calendar.html){target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
- **Complete CITI training.** You will need to complete the curriculum for the learner group "Social Behavioral Research for Investigators and Key Personnel". Please follow these [instructions](https://www.irb.purdue.edu/docs/CITI%20Registration%20Instruction%20Sheet%20Revised%201.29.19.docx) {target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"} to register and begin training. Save the proof of completion into a PDF file named “Last Name_First Name_Course” (use your name and the course you are registered for) and send to the Lab Manager. 
- **Get a Sona account.** Once you have completed CITI training, have someone from the lab (a post doc, grad student, or lab technitian) request a Sona account for you.
