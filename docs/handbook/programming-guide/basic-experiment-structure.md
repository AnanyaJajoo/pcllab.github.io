# Basic Experiment Structure

This section outlines the basic structure and components used in most experiments.

## Login Page & Verification (in-person experiments only)

When you run experiments in the lab, you will need to have a "login" page for the experimenter to type in the subject number and asign the participant to a version/counterbalence condition. 

* lab-start.html will present this page and can be modified based on which/how many parameters need to be set by the experimenter before the start of the experiment.
* verify.html will present a verification page to check that the information input during login was correct.

## Consent Form (online experiments only)

For online experiments, you will need to present a consent page that shows the participants the consent form and asks them if they agree to participate (note: this is techincally a waiver of signed consent).
