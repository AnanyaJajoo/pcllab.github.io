# Starting a New Sona Experiment

<mark>TODO: Include pre-signed copy below</mark>

## Enter the experiment information in Sona

* Log in to Sona: <https://purdue-psych.sona-systems.com/>{target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
* The title of the experiment must include a Sona number and experiment name (e.g., #078: Learning Word Pairs).
* You can reuse an existing Sona number, or you can request a new number from Sue Phebus (PRCE 385G; <sphebus@purdue.edu>).
* You must add "Learning Lab" as a user in each experiment in Sona.
* Make the room number for your experiment PSYC 3105 and instruct students to wait in room 3105 for the experimenter.

## Prepare paperwork for Sue Phebus

You need to prepare the following items:

* One (1) "Request to Use Subjects from the Psychology 120 Subject Pool" form, signed by Jeff. <mark>Include link to pre-signed copy here</mark> You can obtain a pre-signed copy of this form from any key personnel member in the lab.
* Three (3) copies of your consent form. Your consent form must include the correct IRB number, the correct Sona number and experiment title, and correct information about duration and compensation.
* One (1) copy of your debriefing form.
* One (1) copy of your Sona description.

Templates of consent forms, debriefing forms, and Sona descriptions can be found on the LearningLab share in the folder Lab IRB Documents.

## Final Steps

* Make sure all information, including IRB numbers and Sona numbers, is correct on all forms.
* Hand in the forms to Sue Phebus (PRCE 385G).
* You then need to request "Release" (approval) within the Sona System.
* Sue will then approve your experiment within the system.
* Finally, you will receive a stamped consent form from Sue to use as the master consent form to copy and use in your experiment.
* At this point, you are now ready to run subjects.
