# Lab IRB Information

<mark>TODO: Update details about reporting requirements</mark>

## Links

The Purdue IRB website is here: <https://www.irb.purdue.edu/>{target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}

## Importance of the IRB

Every year, I am required to submit a count of the number of subjects tested during the year for all of our IRB protocols. As the Principal Investigator, I am required by the IRB to affirm the following things:

* All signed consent forms are readily accessible to the PI
* All signed consent forms will be accessible to the PI for 3 years following the closure of the IRB protocol
* All personnel involved with the research have current CITI certification in human subjects research

## Current IRB Protocols

Use the table below to determine which IRB protocol you should use for your project. If you have questions, ask Jeff.

## Where to Find Lab IRB documents

Lab IRB documents are stored on the [LearningLab server](lab-connections.md). Go to LearningLab and find the folder called Lab IRB Documents. There you will find folders for each IRB protocol. Within each IRB protocol folder, there are subfolders for:

* **Approval Documents.** These are for reference only.
* **Templates:** This folder includes templates of consent forms and debriefing forms that you will need to tailor for your experiment.
* **Scanned Consent Forms.** This folder is where you will [archive your scanned consent forms](scanning.md).
