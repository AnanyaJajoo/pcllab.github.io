# Scanning and Archiving

When you have completed an experiment, or when you are done running subjects for a while (during the summer), you need to scan and archive your consent forms.

## Scanning Consent Forms

Before you start scanning, your consent forms must:

* Be clean and readable copies
* Contain the correct Sona number and experiment name (e.g., "Sona #087: Criterial Recollection)
* Be signed and dated by the subject
* Be signed by the experimenter
* Be de-identified, meaning that there cannot be information on the consent forms (like subject numbers) that could link the subjects to their data 

## Subject Tally Sheets

* Subject tally sheets are used to keep track of who participated and when.
* They should include the first and last name of each subject along with the date(s)/time they participated.
* Scan the consent forms in the same order as the subjects appear on the tally sheet.
* Scan a copy of the tally sheet and save to with the scanned consent forms.

## How to Scan Documents

Use the walk-up copier located in the PRCE copy center. 

* Select "Scan"
* Enter the email adress that the scanned forms will be sent to
* Title the file using the proper naming conventions (see below)
* Place the stack of forms in the top portion of the scanner
* Tap the square preview section to initiate the scan
* Check that the number of scanned pages matches the number of subjects that participated
* Tap "Send"

## Check Your Scanned Files

When you receive the PDF, check to make sure the scanned PDF matches your tally sheet. That is, if you tested 100 people, there should be 100 pages in the PDF. If these numbers do not match figure out why (e.g., did two pages get scanned as one, did a blank page or debriefing form get scanned on accident, etc.).

## Name Your Scanned Files

Please include the following:

* Sona number (e.g., #087)
* Experiment name (e.g., Criterial Recollection)
* Start date: Date of the earliest consent form in the file (e.g., 2010-9-2)
* End date: Date of the latest consent form in the file (e.g., 2010-9-30)

Example: "#087 Criterial Recollection 2010-9-2 to 2010-9-30.pdf"

## Archive Your Scanned Consent Forms 

Put the PDF(s) of scanned consent forms and the scanned tally sheet the scanned consent forms in the Learning Lab Box IRB folder under the subfolder corresponding to the correct academic year.

## Report Subject Counts on IRB Tracking Sheet

Fill out the subject tracking sheet making sure to record the final subject count, the date scanned/modified, and any relivant notes (e.g., for two-part experiments note how many of the subjects returned for part 2)
