# Scanning and Archiving

<mark>TODO: Fix details on this page</mark>

When you have completed an experiment, or when you are done running subjects for a while (during the summer), you need to scan and archive your consent forms.

## Scanning Consent Forms

[Here is an example](http://learninglab.psych.purdue.edu/labwiki/files/Example_Signed_Consent_Form.pdf){target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"} of what consent forms should look like when they are ready to be scanned and archived.

Before you start scanning, your consent forms must:

* Be clean and readable copies
* Contain the correct Sona number and experiment name (e.g., "Sona #087: Criterial Recollection)
* Be signed and dated by the subject
* Be signed by the experimenter
* Be de-identified, meaning that there cannot be information on the consent forms (like subject numbers) that could link the subjects to their data 

<!-- ## You Must Keep Experiment Logs

* Experiment logs should contain the subject ID, name, and date for each subject
* You should scan experiment logs when you scan your consent forms
* Templates for creating experiment logs are on the [[Getting Started#Connect to the LearningLab Server | LearningLab share ]] in "Lab Documents"
* Here (LINK) is an example of an experiment log -->

<!-- ## When to scan your consent forms

* Scan and archive (LINK) your consent forms when you complete an experiment, or
* Scan and archive at the end of the spring semester, prior to IRB Annual Report due dates -->

## How to Scan Documents

Use the walk-up copier located in PRCE. (Include step by step instructions here. Settings: Black and white. )

## Check Your Scanned Files

When you receive the PDF, check to make sure the scanned PDF matches your experiment log. If you tested 100 people, there should be 100 pages in the PDF. **Before you scan,** put your consent forms in the same order as the experiment log.

## Name Your Scanned Files

Please include the following:

* Sona number (e.g., #087)
* Experiment name (e.g., Criterial Recollection)
* Start date: Date of the earliest consent form in the file (e.g., 2010-9-2)
* End date: Date of the latest consent form in the file (e.g., 2010-9-30)

Example: "#087 Criterial Recollection 2010-9-2 to 2010-9-30.pdf"

## Archive Your Scanned Consent Forms and Record Info on IRB Sheets

Put the PDF(s) of scanned consent forms on LearningLab.
