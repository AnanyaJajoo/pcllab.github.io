# Repositories 


This page describes how to create/clone, use, and organize repositories "repos".


## Clone a GitHub Repository

Cloning makes a copy of a GitHub repository locally on your computer. These instructions are for cloning an existing repository. If you are starting a new project, you will need to Create a New Repository.

* On GitHub, go to the repository you want to clone (e.g., github.com/PCLLAB/RepositoryName).
* Click the "Clone or download" button on the right side of the screen. Then click "Open in Desktop". This will launch the GitHub app.
* Click "Clone" to save the repository in your "htdocs" folder.
* In the GitHub app, there is a "Sync" button in the top right. Clicking Sync pulls the most recent code from GitHub and pushes any changes you have made locally.
