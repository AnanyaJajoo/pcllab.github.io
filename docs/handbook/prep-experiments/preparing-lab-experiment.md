# Preparing a Lab Experiment

Several items need to be prepared by the lead researcher before staring a lab experiment. This page provides an overview of these items. Use the following [checklist](../../downloads/checklist_PreparingLabExperiments.pdf){target="\_blank" rel="noreferrer"} each time you prepare in-lab experiments.

## Create a Shared Digital Folder

Create a shared folder (e.g., on Box - Learning Lab/People/Your subfolder) for all experiment documents and the subject log.

## Prepare Computer Programs

You will need to prepare a computer program to run your experiment. Programming is discussed in our [Lab Programming Guide](../programming-guide/programs.md).

## Prepare Consent Forms, Debriefing, and Sona Description

Templates of consent forms, debriefing forms, and Sona descriptions can be found in the relevant IRB folder on the Learning Lab Box. On consent forms, make sure to change:

- The Sona number/name of the experiment (e.g., "#960 - Memory and Metacognition")
- Information about duration and participation (number of credits)

## Send Experiment Program(s) to Lab Members to Pilot

After your experimental program is finished, send a link to the program to lab members (undergraduate research assistants, graduate students, and postdocs) so that they can review the program and offer feedback. Be sure to give instructions about what version(s) they should test and what type of details they should pay attention to (in applicable). For undergraduate lab members, attach a copy of the [Experiment Piloting Checklist](../../downloads/checklist_PilotingExperiments.pdf).

## Prepare an Experimenter Script

You need a detailed instruction script for experimenters to follow when they run sessions. [Script Template](../../downloads/script_390.docx)

## Prepare Other Paper Documents

Remember to prepare any other paper documents you need (for paper-and-pencil tasks).

## Prepare Experiment Folder(s)

You will need at least one folder in the lab (keep it in the file cabinet in PRCE 184) for blank consent forms, completed consent forms, debriefing forms, and any other paper documents.

## Prepare a Subject Tally Sheet

You must keep a record of which subjects participated in the experiment. This should include, at a minimum, each subject's subject name and the time and date of the session. It is best to list all the subjects that signed up and include a column indicating whether they participated (signed a consent form and got Sona credit), did not show up (did no sign a consent form and did not get Sona credit), or did not participate but did receive credit (only used when there were technical issues or experimenter errors that prevented subjects from participating).  

## Prepare an Experiment Log

You must also keep a log of the subject numbers/sessions for the experiment. At a minimum, the subject log should have each subject number and the date/time of sessions. It is best also to record information about the conditions, counterbalancing order, and notes on each subject.
