2.	**Lab Policies.** This section contains policies and important information about working in the lab on a day to day basis. 
3.	**Running Lab Experiments.** This section provides details about all the steps involved in running experiments in the lab.
4.	**Creating and Running Online Experiments.** This section contains introductory information about web programming and about conducting online experiments.
