# Keeping the Lab Clean

Keeping everything clean in the lab – especially the computers, furniture, and floors – is important because it is part of how we keep everything standardized when we run experiments. 

1.	Remember: No food or drink is allowed in the lab.

2.	Trash cans and recycle bins are located in the hallway outside the lab hallway. 

3.	Cleaning supplies are located in the supply cabinet in room 3131. 

4.	At the end of each day that you run experimental sessions, please clean off all computer keyboards and mice. 

5.	If there are cleanliness issues – for example, dirty carpets, furniture, walls, or computers – please report these issues to Jeff immediately.
