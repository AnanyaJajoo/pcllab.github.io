# Lab Procedures


## Overview of Rooms in the Lab

1.	Room 3131 is the lab's main work room. All paper files associated with each project are stored in this room. The lab supply cabinet is located in this room.

2.	Rooms 3133, 3135, and 3139 are testing rooms for running experiments.

3.	Room 3132 is a shared testing room that any researcher in the department can reserve and use. The link to reserve the room is http://sp.itap.purdue.edu/hhs/psych/events/. 

Using Google Calendars to Reserve Rooms

4.	There are Google calendars for our three lab testing rooms (3133, 3135, and 3139) and one for our lab’s use of the shared testing room (3132). Contact a postdoc or graduate student to be granted access to these Google calendars.

5.	To sign out rooms, click on the calendar for the time you want to sign out. You can do this by clicking at the start time and dragging until the finish time. Make sure no one has signed out the room already. Label the event with your name, the Sona number, and/or a brief experiment name (e.g., "692C Part 1 - Bre").

6.	Only sign out testing rooms if you will actually use the room to run an experiment. Do not sign out testing rooms more than 2 weeks in advance of when you would use them. If you no longer need a time slot, promptly delete it from the Google calendar. Make sure to delete all time slots you do not need (e.g., both sessions of a 2-session experiment).

Overview of Lab Computers

7.	The computers in the testing rooms (3133, 3135, and 3139) are for running experiments. The computers in the work room (3131) can be used for other lab-related purposes (e.g., entering data in a spreadsheet). 

8.	It is fine to check your email and browse the internet, but you must practice safe browsing.
9.	Never download anything to any computers unless you have permission from Jeff.

10.	Do not save any personal documents on the lab computers. 

11.	Please report any computer issues immediately to Jeff or to a postdoc or graduate student you are working with.

12.	Keep the computers clean. When you are done using a testing room on a given day, please clean off all computer keyboards and mice.

## Handling Paper and Electronic Files

1.	All paper files associated with all experiments and projects must be stored in the large file cabinet in the work room (3131).

2.	Each experiment will have one or more file folders associated with it. For example, experiments typically require at least one file folder for blank consent forms and signed consent forms. 

3.	Never take any paper files out of the lab.

4.	Do not take any digital files (e.g., data files or spreadsheets) out of the lab unless you have permission to do so.

## Getting Supplies, Printing, and Making Copies

1.	Supply Cabinet. Our lab's supply cabinet is in the work room (3131). There you can find paper, pens, cleaning supplies, and other supplies. If the supply cabinet is running low on an item, tell someone in the lab (a postdoc, graduate student, or research technician). If we are running short on any supplies, please get more from Phyllis (PRCE 385).

6.	Pens. You will need pens for every experiment. Pens are stored in the supply cabinet in 3131. You will need to get pens from 3131 before each batch of experiment sessions and return the pens to 3131 after each batch of experiment sessions. If we are running short on pens, please go get more from Phyllis (PRCE 360).

7.	Printing. The printer is intended only for lab-related items. The printer is located in room 3119, next to Julie Smith’s office. (The printer IP address is 10.160.108.17)

8.	Copies. You will need paperwork for every experiment. Specifically, you will need printed Consent Forms, but you may need additional paperwork too. Make sure you have all paperwork prior to running an experimental session. If you need to make copies, you will need to do so in the copy room (near PRCE 385).

## Lab Etiquette 

1.	Please talk quietly in the lab. The walls are very thin and there are other labs adjacent to ours.
Lab Keys

2.	Postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and research technicians will have a key to the lab and perhaps other keys (e.g., a building key) provided by Phyllis (PRCE 385).

3.	Undergraduate research assistants will receive a passcode for a key box that contains keys to the lab. You cannot take the keys in the key box with you. You must return keys to the key box immediately after use. This is important because other people in the lab need to use the keys and because this is how we keep the lab secure.

## Lab Security

1.	When you leave a room, turn the lights off, close the door, and make sure the door is locked.

2.	Return the lab key to the key box, and scramble the numbers on the key box.

3.	When you leave the lab each day, make sure that you close any programs you were running on all computers and put away any experiment files you had out. In addition, if you are the last person in the lab, make sure all the lab doors are closed and lights are turned off.

## Keeping the Lab Clean

Keeping everything clean in the lab – especially the computers, furniture, and floors – is important because it is part of how we keep everything standardized when we run experiments. 

1.	Remember: No food or drink is allowed in the lab.

2.	Trash cans and recycle bins are located in the hallway outside the lab hallway. 

3.	Cleaning supplies are located in the supply cabinet in room 3131. 

4.	At the end of each day that you run experimental sessions, please clean off all computer keyboards and mice. 

5.	If there are cleanliness issues – for example, dirty carpets, furniture, walls, or computers – please report these issues to Jeff immediately.
