## Handling Paper and Electronic Files

1.	All paper files associated with all experiments and projects must be stored in the large file cabinet in the work room (3131).

2.	Each experiment will have one or more file folders associated with it. For example, experiments typically require at least one file folder for blank consent forms and signed consent forms. 

3.	Never take any paper files out of the lab.

4.	Do not take any digital files (e.g., data files or spreadsheets) out of the lab unless you have permission to do so.
