# Lab Rooms

## Overview of Rooms in the Lab

- Room 184 in PRCE is the lab's main **work room**. All paper files associated with each project are stored in this room. The lab supply cabinet is located in this room.
- Rooms 181, 182, and 183 in PRCE are **testing rooms** for running experiments.
- Room 3132 in PSY is a shared testing room that any researcher in the department can reserve and use. Postdocs, graduate students and lab managers can reserve this room using the [Psychological Sciences Shared Spaces Calendar](https://purdue0.sharepoint.com/sites/hhs/psych/events/Wiki%20Pages/Home.aspx){target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.

## Using Google Calendars to Reserve Rooms

- There are Google calendars for our three lab testing rooms (PRCE 181, 182, & 183) and one for our labâ€™s use of the shared testing room (PSY 3132). Contact the Lab Manager to be granted access to these Google calendars.
- To sign out a room, click on the calendar for the room you plan to use and reserve it for the date/time(s) you need. Make sure no one has signed out the room already. Then, create an event by clicking on the start time and dragging until the finish time (of the day you are reserving the room during). Label the event with your name followed by the Sona number (e.g., "Brie - #692 Part 1"). Before clicking "save", make sure to select the correct room calendar from the dropdown list.
- Only sign out testing rooms if you will actually use the room to run an experiment. Do not sign out testing rooms more than 2 weeks in advance of when you will be using them. If you no longer need a time slot, promptly delete it from the Google calendar. Make sure to delete all time slots you do not need (e.g., both sessions of a 2-session experiment).
