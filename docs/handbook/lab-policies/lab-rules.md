# Lab Rules

There are a few important rules for working in the lab:

1.	Keep the lab secure. Turn off the lights, close and lock lab doors when you leave rooms, and return lab keys to the key box.
2.	No food or drink in the lab.
3.	If you have an appointment with a subject, you must show up for that appointment.
4.	Keep things organized in the lab, including all paperwork, file folders, and computer files.
5.	Keep things clean in the lab, including all lab rooms and computers.
6.	Look nice in the lab.
7.	If there is ever a problem or you realize you made a mistake, report it immediately. And if you have a question about anything, ask someone.
