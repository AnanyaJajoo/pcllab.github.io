## Lab Keys

1.	Postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and research technicians will have a key to the lab and perhaps other keys (e.g., a building key) provided by John (PRCE 385E).

2.	Undergraduate research assistants will receive a passcode for a key box that contains keys to the lab. You cannot take the keys in the key box with you. You must return keys to the key box immediately after use. This is important because other people in the lab need to use the keys and because this is how we keep the lab secure.

## Lab Security

1.	When you leave a room, turn the lights off, close the door, and make sure the door is locked.

2.	Return the lab key to the key box, and scramble the numbers on the key box.

3.	When you leave the lab each day, make sure that you close any programs you were running on all computers and put away any experiment files you had out. In addition, if you are the last person in the lab, make sure all the lab doors are closed and lights are turned off.
