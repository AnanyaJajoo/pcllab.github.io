## Getting Supplies, Printing, and Making Copies

1.	Supply Cabinet. Our lab's supply cabinet is in the work room (PRCE 184). There you can find paper, pens, cleaning supplies, and other supplies. If the supply cabinet is running low on an item, tell someone in the lab (a postdoc, graduate student, or research technician). If we are running short on any supplies, please get more from John (PRCE 385E).

2.	Pens. You will need pens for every experiment. Pens are stored in the supply cabinet in 184. Before each batch of experiment sessions verify that you have enough pens in the testing room and get more from 184 if needed. If we are running short on pens, let the lab manager know or get more from John (PRCE 385E).

3.	Printing. The printer is intended only for lab-related items. The printer is located in the work room (PRCE 184). To use the printer, follow the [printer setup instructions]<https://www.purdue.edu/hhs/psy/resources/electronics_shop/PrinterSetup.html>{target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"} and enter "\\hhs-print01.boilerad.purdue.edu\PRCE_184_Laser" (windows) or "smb://hhs-print01.b

4.	Copies. You will need paperwork for every experiment. Specifically, you will need printed Consent and Debrief forms, but you may need additional paperwork too. Make sure you have all the paperwork you need prior to running an experimental session. If you need to make copies, you can do so in the copy center (near PRCE 385). If you notice that any of the papers are running low, notify the lab manager or the lead researcher on the experiment so that more copies can be made.
